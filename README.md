# Bank Statement Analysis (2017-2023)

This repository contains an analysis of my bank statements from 2017 to 2023. The purpose of this analysis is to gain insights into my financial transactions, expenses, and trends over the past few years.

## Project Overview

- **Objective:** To understand spending patterns, track income and expenses, and identify financial trends.
- **Duration:** August 2017 - August 2023
- **Author:** Jack Merrett
- **Tools Used:** Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Jupyter Notebook, Excel

## Analysis Process

1. **Data Collection:**
   - Bank statements from Hawaii State Federal Credit Union were collected for the period from 2017 to 2023.
   - Statements were saved in CSV format to facilitate data processing.

2. **Data Preprocessing:**
   - Loaded the CSV files into a pandas DataFrame for analysis.
   - Cleaned the data by handling missing values, duplicates, and formatting issues.

3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
   - Generated summary statistics to understand income, expenses, and balances.
   - Visualized monthly trends in transactions, using line graphs and bar plots.
   - Investigated patterns in spending categories and identified major expense areas.

4. **Financial Trends:**
   - Calculated annual and monthly averages of income and expenses.
   - Analyzed year-over-year changes in income and expenses.
   - Investigated any seasonality or cyclic patterns in the data.

5. **Insights and Findings:**
   - Identified periods of higher expenses (e.g., holidays, vacations).
   - Explored any significant changes in income and expenses over time.
   - Detected any anomalies or irregularities in the transactions.

6. **Future Steps:**
   - Plan to create budgeting strategies based on spending patterns.
   - Consider integrating data from additional financial sources for a comprehensive analysis.
